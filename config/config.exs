# By default, the umbrella project as well as each child
# application will require this configuration file, ensuring
# they all use the same configuration. While one could
# configure all applications here, we prefer to delegate
# back to each application for organization purposes.

# Sample configuration (overrides the imported configuration above):
#
#     config :logger, :console,
#       level: :info,
#       format: "$date $time [$level] $metadata$message\n",
#       metadata: [:user_id]
